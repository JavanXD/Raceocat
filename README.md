## Quickstart

## Architecture Overview

![Race Conditions](./docs/architecture/Race-Architecture.png)

## List of Projects  

### - [Browser Extension for Firefox](./browser-extension/#readme)
Firefox browser extension for live request monitoring and intercepting the desired request which will be forwarded to the Race Dispatcher.

### - [Race Routine Infrastructure](./race-routine-infrastructure/#readme)
Race Dispatcher and Race Script to execute parallel requests against any given endpoint.


### - [OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) Extender](./zap-extender/#readme)
ZAP Extensions to test for Race Conditions.

### - [Vulnerable web application](./vuln-webapp/#readme)
A web application with typical vulnerable use cases such as withdrawing money or excessive poll votes.

## Demo

A demo of the tool and a introduction to race condition vulnerabililties can be watched in this video, which got recorded at Hack in the Box Conference (HITBSecConf) 2022 Singapore:

[![Exploiting Race Condition Vulnerabilities In Web Applications â€“ Javan Rasokat](http://img.youtube.com/vi/rSizIebpBo8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSizIebpBo8&list=PLmv8T5-GONwRu8F1SgdBjP6XydFJipKoa)

In addition a PDF of the research can be found [here](https://opus-htw-aalen.bsz-bw.de/frontdoor/index/index/docId/1327) (in German). 

## To Dos

The following action items are considered to be implemented in a future version (happy for any contributions!):
* Improve timing (by using ntp, a websocket push, or anything else) of the race server to decrease the time gap between dispatching to multiple race servers OR allow a scheduled timing option
* Allow downloading of the HTTP-Responses to analyse the success of the attack
* Allow multiple, different parameters/content of the HTTP-Request to allow improved exploitation of load balancers with sticky sessions and other attack szenarios that require custom parameters
